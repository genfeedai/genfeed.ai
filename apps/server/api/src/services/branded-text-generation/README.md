# Branded text generation seam

`BrandedTextGenerationService.generate(request)` drives one approved-brand text
generation through the saved receipt (#5786):

create → resolve → dispatch → bind artifact → validate

Its only caller today is `POST /posts/draft-generations` with
`brandMode: 'approved_brand'` and a UUID `requestKey`. Requests without
`brandMode` keep the legacy draft behaviour and make no receipt.

## Guarantees

- One provider call per receipt (`OpenRouterService.chatCompletion`, no hidden
  re-dispatch), never retried automatically.
- A missing approved revision, an unsupported capability or an unresolvable
  skill context blocks before any paid dispatch. A branded request never falls
  back to raw.
- Dispatch is recorded when the provider accepts, using the response id. A
  missing id blocks with `provider_attempt_ref_unavailable`.
- The accepted text is saved as a DRAFT post, bound to the receipt by the hash
  of the exact bytes, then validated. Unavailable validation records
  `needs_review`; the receipt is never marked compliant on a failure.

## Replay by receipt state

| State after `create` | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `created` | runs the full flow |
| `resolved`, `dispatched` | `in_progress`, no provider call |
| `checking` | validates only |
| `ready`, `needs_review` | `completed`, the saved post |
| `blocked`, `failed`, `cancelled` | `stopped` with the last error diagnostic code |

A replay is never charged. A same-key request from another actor or with a
changed payload is rejected with `request_payload_conflict`.

## Stable reason codes

`no_approved_revision`, `unsupported_capability`, `provider_attempt_ref_unavailable`
(502), `provider_output_empty` and `channel_limit_exceeded` (422),
`artifact_persist_failed` and `artifact_bind_failed` (500). Responses carry
`meta.brandedGenerationReceiptId`.

## Not wired yet

Onboarding (needs provisional drafts), account and thread generation,
content-intelligence, the agent text path, Studio media, MCP, workflows,
schedules, batches and desktop adapters remain open on #5786.
