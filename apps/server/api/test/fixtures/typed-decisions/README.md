# Typed decision fixtures

Labelled sets for `scripts/typed-decisions/benchmark.ts` (#4864). One JSONL
file per decision point; each line is one labelled example:

```json
{ "question": "…", "options": ["a", "b"], "state": { … }, "expected": "a", "source": "where the label came from" }
```

`expected` picks the question kind: a string is a choice, a number a score, a
boolean a decision. `question` and `options` may be set once on the command
line (`--question`, `--options`) instead of per row.

`reply-bot-intent.example.jsonl` is a four-row example that only exists to make
the script runnable. It is not a benchmark: every migration in epic #4863 ships
its own labelled set, sized to say something about accuracy, and reports the
number before its decision point goes live.
